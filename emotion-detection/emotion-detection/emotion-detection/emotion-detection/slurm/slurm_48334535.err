  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (markers:
  │ python_full_version >= '3.10' and platform_machine == 'arm64' and
  │ sys_platform == 'darwin'):
  ╰─▶ Because tensorflow==2.5.0 has no wheels with a matching Python version
      tag (e.g., `cp313`) and retinaface>=1.1.0 depends on tensorflow==2.5.0,
      we can conclude that retinaface>=1.1.0 cannot be used.
      And because only the following versions of retinaface are available:
          retinaface<0.0.15
          retinaface==1.1.0
          retinaface==1.1.1
      and your project depends on retinaface>=0.0.15, we can conclude that
      your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: Wheels are available for `tensorflow` (v2.5.0) with the following
      Python ABI tags: `cp36m`, `cp37m`, `cp38`, `cp39`

      hint: The resolution failed for an environment that is not the current
      one, consider limiting the environments with `tool.uv.environments`.
